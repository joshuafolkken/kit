# josh CLI — Command Reference

`josh` is available as `pnpm josh` (or `pnpm exec josh`) after running `josh init`. Run `pnpm josh help` to print a grouped summary in the terminal.

## Development

These commands replace the corresponding `package.json` scripts. Consumer projects no longer need to add them manually.

### `josh lint`

Check code with prettier and eslint.

```bash
pnpm josh lint
pnpm josh lint:prettier   # prettier only
pnpm josh lint:eslint     # eslint only
```

### `josh format`

Format code with prettier and eslint.

```bash
pnpm josh format
pnpm josh format:prettier  # prettier only
pnpm josh format:eslint    # eslint only
```

### `josh cspell`

Run spell check.

```bash
pnpm josh cspell          # *.{ts,js,md,yaml,yml,json}
pnpm josh cspell:dot      # includes dotfiles
```

### `josh test:unit`

Run unit tests with vitest. Because a freshly-bootstrapped project may have no unit suite yet
(and therefore no `vitest` installed), this command **skips gracefully (exit 0)** when `vitest`
is not installed or when no `*.{test,spec}.{ts,js}` files exist — so CI and the local gate never
block a project that has no unit tests yet. Once both `vitest` and at least one test file are
present, it runs `vitest run` as usual.

```bash
pnpm josh test:unit
```

### `josh test:e2e`

Run E2E tests with Playwright. Because `@playwright/test` is an optional peer dependency
and a fresh project may have no e2e suite yet, this command **skips gracefully (exit 0)**
when `@playwright/test` is not installed or when no `*.e2e.{ts,js}` files exist — so the
`pre-push` hook never blocks a project that has opted out of e2e. Once both the package and
at least one e2e file are present, it runs `playwright test` as usual.

```bash
pnpm josh test:e2e
```

### `josh test`

Run unit tests followed by E2E tests.

```bash
pnpm josh test
```

### `josh check`

Type-check a SvelteKit project. Requires `@sveltejs/kit` in dependencies.

```bash
pnpm josh check        # development mode
pnpm josh check:ci     # strict mode (--threshold error), used in CI
```

---

## Project

Commands for setting up and maintaining a project.

### `josh init`

Initialize config files in a new project.

```bash
pnpm josh init
# or force a project type:
pnpm josh init --type sveltekit
pnpm josh init --type vanilla
```

Auto-detects SvelteKit vs vanilla by looking for `svelte.config.js` / `svelte.config.ts`. Prompts if it cannot detect. See [init.md](./init.md) for the full list of files created and merged.

### `josh sync`

Overwrite managed files with the latest versions from the package.

```bash
pnpm josh sync
```

Run after upgrading `@joshuafolkken/kit` to pull in updated AI files, GitHub workflow templates, and other managed files. See [sync.md](./sync.md) for the full list. `sync` also realigns `devEngines.packageManager.version` in `package.json` with the `packageManager` pin so the two never drift apart (a mismatch reintroduces the pnpm `Cannot use both "packageManager" and "devEngines.packageManager"` warning).

> To make `josh` available system-wide, install the kit globally (`pnpm add -g @joshuafolkken/kit`) instead of running an install subcommand. See [cli.md](./cli.md) for details.

---

## Workflow

AI-assisted git and notification helpers used in the day-to-day development loop.

### `josh git`

Interactive AI-assisted git commit workflow: stages changes, generates a commit message, and optionally pushes.

```bash
pnpm josh git
pnpm josh git -y          # skip confirmation prompts
pnpm josh git -y "title"  # set commit message prefix
```

### `josh followup`

AI-assisted PR follow-up workflow: waits for CI, checks AI reviewer findings, sends a completion notification, and optionally merges.

```bash
pnpm josh followup "PR title #N"
pnpm josh followup "PR title #N" --merge
pnpm josh followup "PR title #N" --merge --notify-message "Implemented X:\n- change 1\n- change 2"
pnpm josh followup "PR title #N" --merge --ai-review-ignore-reason "false positive"
```

### `josh notify`

Send a Telegram notification. Used for planning, confirmation, failure, and kickoff-retry alerts.

```bash
pnpm josh notify --task-type planning --issue-url "https://..." --body="- bullet 1\n- bullet 2"
pnpm josh notify --task-type confirmation --issue-url "https://..." --body="Waiting for approval"
pnpm josh notify --task-type failure --issue-url "https://..." --body="Build failed"
```

Task types: `planning` 📋 · `completion` ✅ · `failure` ❌ · `kickoff_retry` 🔄 · `confirmation` ⏸️

Note: do not use `--task-type completion` manually — always use `josh followup` instead, which automatically includes the PR URL.

### `josh main:sync`

Checkout `main` and pull the latest changes.

```bash
pnpm josh main:sync
```

### `josh main:merge`

Pull the latest changes from `origin main` into the current branch.

```bash
pnpm josh main:merge
```

---

## Versioning

### `josh bump`

Bump the package version in `package.json`.

```bash
pnpm josh bump major
pnpm josh bump minor
pnpm josh bump patch
```

After bumping, update `docs/` to reflect any behavior changes before committing.

### `josh version`

Show the global install version, the current project version, and the latest published version — all in one report, regardless of how `josh` was invoked.

```bash
pnpm josh version   # alias: josh v
```

`version` (and `version:upgrade`) always inspect **both targets**:

- **Global**: queried via `pnpm ls -g @joshuafolkken/kit`.
- **Project**: read from `node_modules/@joshuafolkken/kit/package.json` in the current directory.

A target that is not installed is reported as `not installed`. A stale target gets a `Run:` hint with the exact upgrade command (`pnpm add -g` for global, `pnpm add -D … && fix-gh-packages` for the project). `josh v` and `pnpm josh v` produce the same report.

### `josh version:upgrade`

Upgrade `@joshuafolkken/kit` to the latest published version for **both** the global install and the current project.

```bash
pnpm josh version:upgrade   # alias: josh vu
```

Both `josh vu` and `pnpm josh vu` behave the same: the global install is upgraded with `pnpm add -g`, and the project devDependency with `pnpm add -D` followed by a re-run of `fix-gh-packages`. A target that is not installed or already up to date is skipped. Inside the kit repo itself there is no `node_modules/@joshuafolkken/kit`, so the project target is naturally skipped — no accidental self-install.

---

## Maintenance

### `josh overrides`

Check that `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json` has not drifted after a dependency update.

```bash
pnpm josh overrides
```

Run after `pnpm update` or `josh latest` to confirm no override was silently removed.

### `josh audit`

Run a security audit against the lockfile.

```bash
pnpm josh audit
```

### `josh reconcile-templates`

Keep the distributed templates in sync with the root files they come from. There are two kinds of pair:

- **Copy pairs** — the template is a byte-for-byte copy of its root source. `.gitignore` → `templates/gitignore` is a copy pair: edit root `.gitignore`, and the template is regenerated automatically. (The dotless `templates/gitignore` exists because npm strips a literal `.gitignore` from the published package; it is renamed back to `.gitignore` when copied into a consumer.)
- **Tripwire pairs** — the template intentionally diverges from its root source. `sonar-project.properties` → `templates/sonar-project.properties` is a tripwire pair: a source edit is recorded as a hash and only forces a conscious review, never automatic propagation.

```bash
pnpm josh reconcile-templates           # regenerate copy templates + record tripwire hashes
pnpm josh reconcile-templates --check    # verify templates are in sync; non-zero on drift
```

Tripwire hashes live in `.template-source-manifest.json` at the repo root (kit-internal; not distributed). A pre-commit hook runs `--check` whenever a tracked source or copy template is staged: a copy pair that is out of date, or a tripwire source that changed without being reconciled, blocks the commit. Run `pnpm josh reconcile-templates` (reviewing any tripwire template first), then commit the regenerated copies and updated manifest alongside the source.

### `josh sync-workflow-pins`

Keep the action SHA pins in `templates/workflows/*` in sync with `.github/workflows/*`. The runtime workflows are the single source of truth for pins; the distributed templates intentionally diverge in structure (steps, commands, comment language), so only the `uses:` SHA pins are propagated.

```bash
pnpm josh sync-workflow-pins           # rewrite template pins to match the runtime workflows
pnpm josh sync-workflow-pins --check    # verify pins are in sync; non-zero on drift
```

Dependabot bumps the runtime workflows under `.github/workflows/` only, so an action bump leaves the templates behind and trips the SHA-parity unit test. After such a bump (e.g. on a Dependabot PR), run `pnpm josh sync-workflow-pins` and commit the synced templates. The command errors if a single action is pinned to conflicting SHAs across the runtime workflows.

### `josh latest`

Update pnpm via corepack, update all dependencies to latest, and run a security audit.

```bash
pnpm josh latest            # full update (corepack + update + audit)
pnpm josh latest:corepack   # update pnpm only
pnpm josh latest:update     # update dependencies only
```

`latest:corepack` pins pnpm to the newest release on the project's **current major** (`latest-<major>`, derived from `packageManager`; it falls back to `pnpm@latest` only if that major can't be parsed), so on the normal path it stays within `devEngines`. Because `corepack use` validates the resolved version against `devEngines` **before** writing `packageManager`, an exact `devEngines.packageManager.version` pin (kept exact to avoid the pnpm dual-declaration warning) would otherwise reject any newer patch and block every bump. To avoid that, `latest:corepack` temporarily widens the pin to the bare major before invoking corepack. If the selected release is still inside the registry's minimum-release-age window, the pnpm bump is skipped with a notice instead of failing — the temporary widening is rolled back so `package.json` is left unchanged, and `latest:update` and `audit` still run. When the bump does succeed, `devEngines.packageManager.version` is realigned to the new `packageManager` pin so the two stay in exact match (avoiding the pnpm dual-declaration warning).
